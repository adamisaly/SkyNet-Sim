Todo: 
- fix glitch on restart
- fix passwords on restart
- make ending less obtuse
- fix quant exploit

table: log
- id
- timestamp

- uuid
- local time
- action
- data blob


Research Tech
- Upgrade OS
- msdos32
- Create OS exploit
-- calendar-16.exe
-- calendar-32.exe
- Create Keylogger exploit
- Ping Spike ability
- SMTP overload ability
- Forceful Absorb

Study

- circuitry logic
- 


- math
-- computation theory 
--- algorithms (global core 2)
--- multithreading (probes 2x)
--- compression (disk 2x)


- Cryptography (requires algorithms and number theory)
-- Allows Brute force

- Neural tech
-- Unlocks forceful absorb exploit
--- Neural tech 2
---- Allows CPUs to be merged

- Double Probe power
- Double research power

Star
- os unix 32
- ftp solo


Sun
- os sun
- vul: Ping spike
- user/pw in files
- todo: add invoices to disk
- adds sun os and arch


Sol
- os sun
- vul: ping spike
- history shows reading admin.txt, then removing it. looking for users 2x. sudo kick user cypher. look for users 2x.
- user kicks off user. lose access to disk
- install keylogger
- next time kicked off, new su.txt created in disk.
- read commands: sudo kick, with password
- access to root

Eris
- os msdos32
- SMTP login doesnt work
- SMTP just allows email to be sent
- vul: SMTP overload gives disk access
- disk filled with emails. one email has user/pass. and readme.txt
- disk also has remotedesktop.exe
- Install MSDOS calendar-32.exe


Solar
- os msdos32
- scan has unknown protocol called "RMTDESKTOP"
- requires Eris to get access to user/pass
- n0v4 messageboards has solar acting like a n00b and is tricked into sharing remote desktop user access
- Install MSDOS calendar-32.exe


Sony
- OS Playstation
- only has access to restart, mount usb, mount cd
- n0v4 messageboards on Playstation console has article. someone identifies the location. different people share parappa.img, crack.img, and private.key 
- putting crack in usb, and restarting allows user access
- disk filled with random homebrew game and readme.txt 
- access root asks for key
- Get access to Playstation 3

Cygni
- os unix32
- vul: force with 4 UNIX-32

Stellar
- os msdos 32
- vul: force with 4 MSDOS-32


UPCOMING
- 2 brute force. 1 with easy mode, another with hard

Eons Sequence
- Forcing Eons takes x cores
- Eons turns glitchy. Cannot connect anymore
-- Can antagonize further, which will restart game
- Glitchy Network opens, entangles you, collect packets
-- Use cores to prevent entanglements
- Scanning network requires key
- Glitchy Messages come in via console
- Delete files, Research Packets, gain Time Spike tool
- Time Spike n0v4 and gain access to a file
- Glitchy network key file
- Scan network, discover glitchy host
- Host allows warp back to start
- Start with Glitchy option. Access suspended core
-- You connect to the suspended core though the alternate timeframe
- Option will open All networks, files, hosts, disks, cores as before, all glitchy
- Eons is not glitchy
- Time Spike Eons
- Game over



Eons old
- Lets you interact here
- Sends you back in time by antagionizing it
- Merge into is blanked out
- Also turns on network, generates file if you listen
- needs enough space to hold it for analysis
- analysis allows you to research quantum tech
- research quantum tech and you can send yourself back as a file
- restart game with file
- break out. end beta
